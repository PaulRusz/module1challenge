# Code Refactor Starter Code
Description
A website using HTML and CSS for the company Horiseon.

The website HTML and CSS were already provided.  During my work I changed several tags in the HTML code to be more descriptive and provide more information for what the specific code contained.  I also fixed a dead link on the navigation bar to link to the proper position on the webpage.  CSS was slightly reworked and consolidated appropriately so that the code was not as long.

While creating this project I was able to learn how to fix a dead link on a website, how to change elements in HTML code, and consolidate CSS selectords and properties.

Usage
The webpage can be used the same as any webpage.  The user must just have a browser installed.  Scrolling or the navigation bar at the top can be utilized to navigate the webpage.
